Problem 1:
- [ ] Create a dockerfile for nginx image with different html content and different nginx conf that listen to port 8080 instead of port 80 on the container
- [ ] Run a container from the new image

Problem 2:
- [ ] Create a dockerfile to containerize a simple reactjs app
- [ ] Run a container from the new image

Problem 3: 
- [ ] create a dockerfile for the same app in smaller size using multi staging
- [ ] Run a container from the new image

Problem 4: 
- [ ] Create a dockerfile for ubuntu image which sleeps according to the given number in the docker command (hint: CMD override) or sleeps by default for 15 sec (if not overridden by the user)
- [ ] Run a container from the new image and test the 2 scenarios

Problem 5:
- [ ] Push the images created in Problem #(3 & 4) into your docker hub repo (hint: create an account in dockerhub and use `docker login` command in your terminal)
